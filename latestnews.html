            <h2><b><u>Clash of clan</u></b></h2>
            <p>Clash of Clans is a 2012 free-to-play mobile strategy video game developed and published by Finnish game developer Supercell. The game was released
                 for iOS platforms on August 2, 2012, and on Google Play for Android on October 7, 2013.

                The game is set in a fantasy-themed[3] persistent world[4] where the player is a chief of a village. Clash of Clans tasks players to build their
                 own village using the resources gained from attacking other players' villages with troops, earning rewards, buying them with medals or by
                  producing them at their own village. Players can conjoin to create clans - groups of up to fifty people - who can then participate in Clan Wars
                   together, donate and receive troops, and chat with each other. The minimum number of players of a Clan War is thirty.
                
                Clash of Clans was released to generally positive reviews from critics. Four spin-off games in the same universe of Clash of Clans were developed
                 by Supercell. The first, Clash Royale, was released in 2016.[6] The other three, Clash Quest, Clash Mini, and Clash Heroes, were announced in
                  April 2021. Clash Quest development was discontinued on 17 August 2022.</p>

            <h2><b><u>League of legend</u></b></h2>
            <p>League of Legends (short: LoL or just League ) is a multiplayer online battle arena computer game (MOBA) developed and operated by the American
                 Riot Games , which was released on October 27, 2009 for Windows and macOS . It was released as a free-to-play title and at one point was played
                  by around 100 million players per month. 

                The gameplay is inspired by Defense of the Ancients , a mod for Warcraft III . In the classic game mode of League of Legends, two teams of five
                 players compete against each other. Each player controls a piece from a bird's eye view across the square playing field and tries to defend their
                 own half of the playing field. The aim of the game is to destroy the opponent's base in the opposite corner of the playing field from your own
                  base. Over the course of a 20 to 50 minute game, the characters steadily gain in strength and equipment.
                
                League of Legends is a popular discipline in esports . With an international fan and player scene as well as nine umbrella leagues and numerous 
                regional leagues, the game is regularly referred to as the world's largest e-sport. Tournaments, such as the annual League of Legends World 
                Championship , were watched by over 100 million viewers at times.</p>
